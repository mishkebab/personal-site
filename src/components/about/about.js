                        Early in my career, I analyzed geospatial data as a Solutions Engineer at Orbital Insight, a Sequoia-backed startup in Silicon Valley.

                        I graduated from Princeton University, where I was elected Vice President of my class. If not coding, I can usually be found outdoors. Most recently, I completed the Salkantay Trek in Peru.
